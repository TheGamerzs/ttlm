                This started out as a quick personal project to make my life easier. <br>
                I'm still in the process of taking all the completed features and converting the code over for multiple users to use.<br>
                It's likely for you to come across errors that I haven't accounted for yet, and I'm actively working on solving those issues.

                My end goal is to make this the ultimate tool possible within the limits of the data available.
